# object_detection_paper

This repository hosts mock data and computational notebooks for the paper: <i>"How can object detection be used to understand drivers of consumption space attractiveness?"</i>

The notebook `maskrcnn_predictions.ipynb` demonstrates how to extract object-level predictions using the Mask R-CNN architecture using mock images. `visualisations.ipynb` and `modelling.ipynb` provide code to reproduce the visualisations and regression output, respectively.
